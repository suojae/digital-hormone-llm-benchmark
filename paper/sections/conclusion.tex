\section{Conclusion}
We presented a tri-axis digital hormone controller that compresses heterogeneous agent signals into a bounded internal state and modulates LLM invocation parameters to improve utility--risk--cost trade-offs. The method is model-agnostic and designed for reproducible evaluation in interactive benchmarks. Future work includes learning event functions while preserving interpretability and extending the state representation beyond three axes.
