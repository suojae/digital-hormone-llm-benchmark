\section{Ethical Considerations}
We use the term ``emotion'' as a functional metaphor for internal control signals, not as a claim about sentience or clinical mental states. We recommend describing high-cortisol regimes as \emph{risk-off} or \emph{defensive} modes to avoid anthropomorphic or stigmatizing framing. Evaluation should be conducted in sandboxed environments (e.g., WebArena) rather than on live platforms.
