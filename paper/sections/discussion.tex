\section{Discussion and Limitations}
Our controller provides an interpretable state-compression layer for multi-objective control in LLM agents. The approach is lightweight and model-agnostic, but depends on calibrated event functions $\Delta_d$ and $\Delta_c$. If cortisol is over-sensitive, the agent may become overly conservative; if under-sensitive, the agent may incur avoidable risk. LLM-judge evaluation is convenient but biased \cite{zheng2023judging}; we recommend a human-evaluated subset.
